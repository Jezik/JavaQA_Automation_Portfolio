# Automation QA Portfolio Project
The idea of this project is to create some sort of portfolio for SDET.
I'm going to combine automation with Java, Selenium, Cucumber and some kind of API testing framework.

The target will be some open-source web application providing possibilities for UI and API automation.

Reports will be generated via Allure. I'm going to implement running tests in Docker and with Github Actions - 
this part is absolutely new to me and subject to review and change. But I'm going to learn something new from this project.
